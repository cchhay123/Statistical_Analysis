# Statistical Analysis Coursework

This repository showcases key assignments highlighting my knowledge and practical experience in probability, hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and statistical modeling using R.

## Case Study: Revenue and Profit Analysis

- **Hypothesis Testing**: Conducted multiple hypothesis tests including `t-tests` and `proportion tests` to compare revenues and unit prices across different pricing conditions.
- **Correlation and Regression Analysis**: Performed regression analysis (`lm()`) to explore the significance of relationships between merchandise revenue and number of tickets sold.
- **Visualization**: Utilized `ggplot2` to create insightful visualizations supporting statistical findings.

*Goal*: Apply hypothesis testing and regression analysis to interpret and predict business performance effectively.

## Probability Theory and Applications

- **Probability Fundamentals**: Applied concepts of probability distributions, calculations of event probabilities, and interpretation of probabilistic outcomes.
- **Statistical Reasoning**: Developed skills to critically analyze and interpret probabilistic scenarios and outcomes within given contexts.

*Goal*: Build strong foundational understanding of probability to inform statistical inference and decision-making.

## Correlation, Standard Deviation, and Random Sampling

- **Correlation Analysis**: Conducted correlation studies to measure the strength and direction of relationships between variables.
- **Standard Deviation and Variability**: Calculated and interpreted standard deviations to understand variability within data.
- **Random Sampling and Hypothesis Testing**: Implemented random sampling methods and conducted hypothesis tests to draw reliable inferences about populations.

*Goal*: Enhance analytical skills through practical application of correlation analysis, variability measurements, and robust statistical inference.
